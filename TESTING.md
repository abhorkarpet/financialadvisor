```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas reportlab
```

### 2. Run the Application

**Step 2: Asset Configuration**
- **Set Default Growth Rate** - Configure the default annual growth rate for investment accounts (slider: 0-20%)
  - Typical rates: Stocks 7-10%, Bonds 4-5%, Savings 2-4%
  - This rate auto-populates when adding accounts
- Choose one of the 3 setup methods:

### 4. Adjust Advanced Settings (Sidebar)

Click **"⚙️ Advanced Settings"** in the sidebar (collapsed by default) to adjust:

- **Projected Retirement Tax Rate** - Expected tax rate in retirement
- **Expected Inflation Rate** - Long-term inflation assumption

### 5. Reset and Start Over

Click the **"🔄 Reset Onboarding"** button in the sidebar to start fresh.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 8501 is already in use:

```bash
streamlit run fin_advisor.py --server.port 8502
```

### Missing Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit pandas reportlab
```

### Clear Cache

If you encounter unexpected behavior:

```bash
streamlit cache clear
```

Then restart the application.
